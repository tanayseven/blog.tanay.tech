# Page the idea

After a couple of years after writing android apps, I chose to write an
android app again. I had used Android Studio before but never tired
serious android development after the very first time I tried it in
Eclipse (the old times when there was not android studio).

I chose a very old idea that I had before for voting. I thought I will
make an app that accepts votes from people. This had to be something
different from the regular apps. The main difference being that people
should not have to install an app and/or should not have to open to a
website to cast a vote. Hence, people should use the platform they are
already using. Therefore I chose to go in for some messaging platform.
The most popular platform out there is Whatsapp but again the problem
with Whatsapp is that they don't have any open APIs and moreover it's
illegal to reverse engineer the Whatsapp APIs. The other option is
Telegram who have their APIs completely open. But the problem with doing
it with Telegram is that they have very few users compared to Whatsapp.
I had to settle somewhere in between the two choices. That's the reason
I chose traditional SMS over Telegram or Whatsapp.

# Concept and design choices

Now it was time to design the app for voting but directly jumping for
voting was a bit too much for processing and adding too much to the
design and in addition to that some extra time in the development of the
project. I thought of making it very simple and just storing the SMSes.
So I finalised with the idea of writing an app that will accept
registrations through the means of SMSes. Hence the name SMServer, a
Short Message Server, the server with which people can accept SMSes from
the user and store them.

# How the app worksː

The basic idea is to accept the SMSes in a particular format . Suppose
you are accepting the applications for a party that you are hosting it
will be as follows. For example, let's say I'm hosting an event and I
want to accept the people's names via SMS. So I will create a new form
for accepting the people who are willing to join the event. Suppose the
event is some music show, I will accept the applications in the
following format.

`MUSIC<space>NAME<space>AGE`

Suppose John Doe is registering for an event, his message will be as
follows:

`MUSIC John 27`

All the words that I'm accepting via the app are case insensitive. The
reason being that there should be no mismatch between the words being
just because of the case. At least the first word has to be kept case
insensitive.

## A screen to screen working for the app

<figcaption>Now you click on the right-top corner menu button for
creating a new form</figcaption>

<figcaption>These are the details that you have to fill up to accept
registrations</figcaption>

<figcaption>Fill up this form</figcaption>
</figure>

-   The name for the new form is the name that you want to give to the
    form which will accept registrations, the form name will be for your
    own reference
-   The starting date and time are the date and time when the form
    should start accepting the entries
-   Same goes for the ending time and date
-   The first word is the first word that you have to enter to enter to
    accept the entry as an entry for this particular form
-   The fields are the remaining words from the SMS that you will be
    accepting as fields in the form
-   The form will be saved when you click the save button

<figcaption>After opening the form you can see the details of the
form</figcaption>

<figcaption>Now send an SMS to yourself with that format, I’ll send the
same SMS (music john 28)</figcaption>

<figure>
<img src="/images/smserver_images/11_entry_made.png" className="align-center"
width="500" alt="images/smserver_images/11_entry_made.png" />
<figcaption>Then you can go to the main screen and come back by opening
the form and you will see the entry for the newly received
SMS</figcaption>

<img src="/images/smserver_images/08_form_menu.png" className="align-center"
width="500" alt="images/smserver_images/08_form_menu.png" />
<figcaption>You can then click the form and say “Save the records” this
will allow you to share the CSV file, keep in mind that you have to
select an app that allows sending of CSV files, I’ll recommend to use an
email app and you can also delete the form</figcaption>
